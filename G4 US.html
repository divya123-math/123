Helpful Conversions to Remember: 1 gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 2 pints, 1 pint = 2 cups, 1 gallon = 16 cups. Steps to Solve Word Problems: Understand what is being asked. Identify units used (cups, pints, etc.). Convert all measurements to the same unit if needed. Choose the correct operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Solve and label your answer.",
